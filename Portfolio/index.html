						Don't you see how great this is? You, you are a... Jesse look at me.
						You... are a blowfish. A blowfish! Think about it. Small in stature,
						not swift, not cunning. Easy prey for predators but the blowfish has
						a secret weapon doesn't he. Doesn't he? What does the blowfish do,
						Jesse. What does the blowfish do? The blowfish puffs up, okay? The
						blowfish puffs himself up four, five times larger than normal and
						why? Why does he do that? So that it makes him intimidating, that's
						why. Intimidating! So that the other, scarier fish are scared off.
						And that's you! You are a blowfish. You see it's just all an
						illusion. You see it's... it's nothing but air. Now... who messes
						with the blowfish, Jesse? You're damn right. You are a blowfish. Say
						it again. Say it like you mean it. You're a BLOWFISH!

								<p>I need your full attention, Saul. Jesse Pinkman current whereabouts. The sooner you tell me, the sooner you can get back to whatever the hell this is exactly. Whoa, you are good right there. Now lets both get comfortable. Now when I say I'm looking for Pinkman, we both know why, don't we. And you pretending otherwise only wastes my time and serves to annoy me. I trust the hole in the desert I'd leave you in. Don't make me beat you 'til your legs don't work. Now tell me where to find him, you know it's the right thing. 

										I promise you this, either we're all going home or none of us are. Now settle down. On your feet.</p>

No I'm just saying that, though I really do, I understand the temptation to restart the business... maybe the universe is telling you that you need to pay what you owe. </p>
